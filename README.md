# CPS530 Term Project - Laravel and Vue.js
This is my term project for CPS530 Fall 2021 at Toronto Metropolitan University. The demo page is a simple photo gallery created with a Laravel REST API and a Vue.js frontend.

The project was originally deployed on DigitalOcean with a MySQL database, but I have since migrated the live page to Render with a PostgreSQL database.

Installation instructions, documentation, and the demo can be accessed [here](https://cps530.onrender.com).

## Next Steps
- More API functionality (adding, deleting, sorting, filters, etc.)
